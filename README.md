Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-stack Developer with a strong focus on backend development using Laravel, Python, and React.

I also enjoy developing frontend interfaces, leveraging React and Vue.js. For design, I utilize tools like Figma and Excalidraw.

My toolkit includes Docker, GitHub, and Postman. I'm also proficient in database analysis and configuration.

Currently, I serve as the CEO of Enfantia.

I enjoy taking initiative in projects and am always curious about new professional opportunities.
